# Online-Order-Sales-Data

This information on online order sales includes information about the products, locations, clients, and salespeople as well as data from the previous three years.

I generated a new spreadsheet called "Combine Analysis," on which I conducted analysis.

I started by attaching the sheets (2019, 2020, 2021), then I used VLOOKUP to extract the data from several tables based on primary key and foreign key, then I computed total cost, total sales, total tax, gross revenue, and net profit.

I made another sheet, called Analysis, and on it I displayed some basic statistics and summaries, such as total sales, total profit, average sales, the number of products, etc. After that, I developed several profiles, including one for each year, month, location, customer, salesperson, etc., where I calculated the financial analysis for three years.

Finally, I produced the dashboard sheet, on which I had carried out a number of visualisations that would make it simple for you to comprehend and make decisions.
